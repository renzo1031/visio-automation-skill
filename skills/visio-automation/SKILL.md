description: Use whenever the user wants Codex to control Microsoft Visio directly for editable diagrams: create or modify .vsdx files, use built-in stencils/masters/native dynamic connectors, replicate screenshots or whiteboards, discover missing masters, fix connector routing/gluing, convert Mermaid or draw.io into Visio, inspect ShapeSheet behavior, or avoid non-native SVG/XML-only diagrams. Strongly prefer this skill for Visio, .vsdx, stencil, master, ShapeSheet, dynamic connector, flowchart, BPMN, UML, network, org chart, DFD, VSM, or "use Visio's own shapes".

# Visio Automation

Create and modify diagrams by controlling real Microsoft Visio through COM automation. The target artifact is an editable `.vsdx` using built-in Visio masters, native dynamic connectors, glued endpoints, and ShapeSheet settings that survive manual editing.

## Default Rules

- Run user-facing Visio work in foreground visible mode by default so the user can watch the diagram appear. Use `New-InvisibleVisioApplication` only when the user explicitly asks for background/headless operation, or for narrow internal discovery/verification where no user-facing document is being drawn.
- Prefer Visio built-in stencils and `NameU` masters. Use primitive basic shapes only when no semantic master exists or the user wants a deliberately generic sketch.
- Build a lightweight Graph Model before drawing non-trivial diagrams, conversions, image reconstructions, or tasks without clear coordinates.
- Use Visio connector masters plus `GlueToPos`; do not draw loose lines for relationships that should move with shapes.
- Preserve requested or observed connector routing: orthogonal stays orthogonal, straight stays straight, curved stays curved.
- Save the `.vsdx`, export a PNG preview when useful, then verify the resulting document before reporting completion.

## Choose What To Read

Read only the files needed for the current request:

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Choose diagram family, stencil, or master | `references/diagram-selection.md`, then `references/master-catalog.md` if needed |
| Unknown or localized master/stencil | `references/master-discovery.md` |
| Natural-language master lookup, Chinese/English aliases, repeated edits | `references/semantic-search-and-cache.md` |
| Render a planned graph, auto-layout, natural-language flow, arrow text flow, Mermaid, or draw.io | `references/graph-model-and-conversion.md` |
| Recreate screenshot, whiteboard, PDF crop, or sketch | `references/image-reconstruction.md` |
| Verify routing, glue, ShapeSheet cells, output files | `references/verification.md` |
| Need Visio COM, VBA, or ShapeSheet API details | `references/official-docs.md` |

Always load the helper script instead of retyping COM boilerplate:

```powershell
. "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\visio-automation\scripts\visio_helpers.ps1"
```

Useful helpers include:

- Visio app/document: `New-VisibleVisioApplication`, `New-InvisibleVisioApplication`, `Get-OpenVisioDocumentByPath`
- Stencils/masters: `Open-VisioStencilReadOnly`, `Get-VisioEnvironment`, `Build-VisioMasterIndex`, `Find-VisioMasters`, `Find-SemanticVisioMaster`
- Graph rendering/conversion: `Render-VisioGraphModel`, `Invoke-VisioGraphLayout`, `Convert-NaturalLanguageFlowToVisio`, `Convert-TextFlowToVisio`, `Convert-MermaidToVisio`, `Convert-DrawIOToVisio`, `Convert-ImageReconstructionToVisio`
- Shape/connector editing: `Set-VisioTextStyle`, `Set-VisioShapeFill`, `Set-VisioShapeBounds`, `Connect-VisioShapesOrthogonal`, `Connect-VisioShapesStraight`, `Connect-VisioShapesCurved`
- Routing policy: `Resolve-VisioRoutingIntent`, `Resolve-VisioRouteDecision`, `Get-VisioRoutingDefault`, `Resolve-VisioLoopbackGlue`
- Session cache: `Get-VisioSessionCache`, `Update-VisioSessionCache`, `Add-VisioSessionRecentMaster`

## Core Workflow

1. Classify the diagram family from the user's intent.
2. Read the relevant reference file from the table above.
3. Select native stencils/masters through the catalog, semantic search, or local discovery.
4. Normalize the diagram into a Graph Model when the structure is more than a few manually placed shapes.
5. Render with visible Visio by default, using native masters and glued dynamic connectors.
6. Save `.vsdx`, export a preview when useful, verify output and connector behavior, then summarize the result.

## Practical Notes

- Use `pwsh` for scripts containing UTF-8 Chinese text. Windows PowerShell 5 may misparse UTF-8 files without BOM.
- Keep stencils hidden/read-only with `OpenEx(..., 66)` to avoid save prompts.
- Do not close the user's visible Visio window unless they explicitly ask.
- Avoid generating raw `.vsdx` XML for editable diagrams; it often lacks the native master and connector behavior the user cares about.
- Keep the task script in the workspace when future edits are likely.
